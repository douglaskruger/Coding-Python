# Description:
#   This prototype demonstrates publishing information and receiving information 
#   over sockets. It is the master driver script. If the script does not work, 
#   check the IP addresses in the scripts. Beware that the python runs in the 
#   background - so it may live beyond exiting this demo script - so you may 
#   need to kill it separately.
